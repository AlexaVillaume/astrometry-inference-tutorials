# astrometry-inference-tutorials
This is the __placeholder repository__ for the tutorials that accompany the Gaia DR2 paper (Luri et
al. 2018, A&A Special Issue for Gaia DR2) describing recommended practices for the use of
astrometric data (in particular parallaxes) in astronomical data analysis problems.

The official repository will be hosted by the
[ESA Bitbucket
repository](https://repos.cosmos.esa.int/socci/projects/GAIA/repos/astrometry-inference-tutorials/browse)
from April 16 2018 onward.

## Tutorials

* [Luminosity calibration](./luminosity-calibration)
* [Infer distance to a single source](./single-source)
* [Infer distance to and size of a cluster](./multiple-source)
* [Infer distance and velocity of a source](./3d-distance)
* [The period luminosity relation](./period-luminosity-relation)
