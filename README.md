# astrometry-inference-tutorials
This is the repository for the tutorials that accompany the Gaia DR2 paper [Luri et
al. 2018, A&A Special Issue for Gaia DR2](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201832964) (also
available on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09376)) describing recommended practices for the
use of astrometric data (in particular parallaxes) in astronomical data analysis problems.
