# astrometry-inference-tutorials
This is the placeholder repository for the tutorials that accompany the Gaia DR2 paper (Luri et al.
2018) describing recommended practices for the use of astrometric data (in particular parallaxes) in
astronomical data analysis or inference problems.

## Tutorials

* [Luminosity calibration](./luminosity-calibration)
* [Infer distance to a single source](./single-source)
* [Infer distance to and size of a cluster](./multiple-source)
* [Infer distance and velocity of a source](./3d-distance)
* [The period luminosity relation](./period-luminosity-relation)
